This is a simple Flask-based API application that processes receipts, calculates points based on certain rules, and stores receipt information. The application provides two main endpoints: one for processing new receipts and one for retrieving points for a specific receipt.

Features:
Receipt processing: Receives a receipt in JSON format, processes it, and calculates points based on various rules.
Retrieve points: Allows querying the calculated points for a specific receipt by its ID.
